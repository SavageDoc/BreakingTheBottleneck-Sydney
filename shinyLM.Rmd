## Executive Summary

- Discussion of implementation of Random Forest or Linear Model was held on `r Sys.time()`
- Facilitated by `r Sys.info()['user']`
- Decision reached to implement the Linear Model 

## Rationale

```{r reasons, comment='', results='asis'}
for( reason in params$reasons ){
  cat( paste( '-', reason, "\n" ) )
}
```

## Next Steps

- Code and technical documentation to be delivered to validation
- Support for governance committees to be arranged.
